                SEDS at Tennessee Tech is a club led by students for students for the development and exploration of
                space. Currently the club participates in projects in amateur rocketry, high altitude balloons, radio
                communications, and telescope/radio imaging. We are also always interested in hosting or sponsoring
                different projects, and we welcome additional project suggestions. TNTech SEDS is a chapter of the
                larger SEDS USA which has chapters in several different colleges and high schools listed below:

                SEDS USA is 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to the evolution and expansion of space in the
                academic and professional sectors. SEDS was founded as a chapter-based organization in 1980 by Peter
                Diamandis, Scott Scharfman, and Richard Sorkin. It is the largest student-run space organization in the
                world and consists of an international community of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students
                from a diverse range of educational backgrounds in chapters all over the world. The SED-USA mission
                statement embodies everything we strive for in TnTECH SEDS, and so we adopt it as our mission statement
                with a few differences shown in PURPLE:

                <em>Tennessee Tech</em> Students for the Exploration and Development of Space
                (<b><em>TNTECH</em></b>SEDS) is an organization
                that empowers young people to participate and make an impact in space exploration, <em>and to discover a
                    passion for space with other space enthusiastic students.</em> SEDS helps students develop their
                technical
                and leadership skills by providing opportunities to manage and participate in national projects as well
                as to attend conferences, publish their work, and develop their professional network, in order to help
                students become more effective in their present and future careers in industry, academia, government,
                and education.

            <h2>Club Meetings</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Club meetings take place every Wednesday night at 7 PM during semesters, and usually last till 9 PM. The
                meetings will usually follow one of two schedule types: General or Project, or some combination of the
                two. Occasionally there will also be Game Nights for members to come relax and play games. Updates about
                meetings will be posted to the student discord, student email, and on the website homepage. Members and
                non-members are welcome to come to any meeting.

                <p>
                    General meetings will feature an event speaker or a presentation from one of the student members.
                    The meeting itinerary will include club updates, event changes, and space news from the week.

                <img src='photos/nerds.png'>
                <p>Project meetings are frequent in the spring semester when club projects are coming to an end. Project
                    meetings offer members a reserved time to work on club projects, and help to keep projects on

                <p>Once or twice a semester the club will come together and play board games or have a paper airplane
                    competition. Occasionally the club will also have Game Nights in collaboration with other TNTech

                    <h4>President</h4>
                    <p>Joshua is a masters student in mechanical engineering. He once flew an RC-helicopter and didn't
                        crash it, so he figured he could probably run a club about space. He has taken several classes
                        in fluid dynamics and knows far too much for his own good. Joshua runs the meetings and
                        generally keeps the club running. Do not ask him questions about fluids, and if he starts
                        talking about it on his own RUN AWAY!!!</p>

                    <p>
                        Parker is an undergrad student in mechanical engineering. He currently holds a level 2 rocketry
                        certification, and is building a rocket for his level 3 attempt. As vice president Parker is
                        required to cover any of the president's roles that he can not fulfill by himself. Running a
                        club can be hard sometimes, okay? Parker is also the undisputed best-dressed officer of the
                        hour, every hour.

                        the obvious choice for secretary. Jim's position includes several duties such as taking role,
                        keeping the schedule and the website up to date, and reminding people that single-use plastic is
                        wack.</p>

                        Jackie is the project manager for the club. When the club is in the middle of a lot of projects,
                        Jackie is quite busy. When the club is not doing a lot of projects, you can find a bored-looking
                        Jackie in the library or in Prescott. Project manager works with each of the project leaders to
                        make sure deadlines will be met, and funding is properly allocated.

                    <p>
                        Caroline is an undergrad student in chemical engineering. Caroline recently completed a project
                        where she carbonated sodas with yeast. She discovered that when you forget about
                        yeast-carbonating sodas, eventually they can explode. Caroline is in charge of making sure dues
                        are paid and funding deadlines are met. Members that forget to pay dues to Caroline get what is
                        coming to them. You have been warned.

                        active on the various social medias and reaching out to find event speakers, other SEDS
                        organizations, and administrations in the school. It may sound like this is a lot for one
                        person, but then on the other hand it is just a bunch of browsing on Facebook.</p>
